## Example Data Set

Download the example data set from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15789063). It corresponds to Version 4 of the data set "A Corpus of Biblical Names in the Greek New Testament to Study the Additions, Omissions, and Variations across Different Manuscripts." To import it, use `GreekVariant4.json`, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Paulanerus/TextExplorer/blob/master/example/GreekVariant4.json) (for more information, see [Data Import](usage.md)).

Additionally, a plugin for this data set can be downloaded from the [official release page](https://github.com/Paulanerus/TextExplorer/releases/latest) (demo.jar).
Both plugins and data sets can be loaded directly within the application, as documented [here](usage.md).
